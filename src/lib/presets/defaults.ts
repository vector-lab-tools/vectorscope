/**
 * Default presets for Vectorscope operations.
 *
 * Each operation exports its own preset array. The shape varies: text-only
 * operations use `TextPreset`, layer-bound operations use `TextLayerPreset`,
 * numeric-config operations use `SampleSizePreset`, and Generation Vector
 * carries a full sampling-config bundle.
 *
 * Where a preset depends on model topology (e.g. "mid layer"), the layer is
 * stored as a symbolic `LayerSpec` and resolved at click time via
 * `resolveLayer(spec, numLayers)`. This keeps presets portable across GPT-2
 * (12 layers), Llama 3.2 1B (16 layers), Mistral 7B (32 layers), etc.
 *
 * Presets are chosen to be theoretically loaded where possible — they gesture
 * at contested concepts, subject-verb agreement traps, bias probes, and other
 * phenomena relevant to vector-conformism analysis. Generic test strings are
 * kept to a minimum.
